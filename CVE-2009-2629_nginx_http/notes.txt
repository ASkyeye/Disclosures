    06.06.2019. Check if the merge_slashes directive is required

ngx_http_parse_complex_uri:
...
    case sw_dot_dot:
...
    case '/':
        state = sw_slash;
        u -= 4;     // <--------- culprit
        if (u < r->uri.data) {
            return NGX_HTTP_PARSE_INVALID_REQUEST;
        }
        while (*(u - 1) != '/') {
            u--;
        }

`u` contains the URI. It must be 4+ characters long to pass the check < r->uri.data. If the URI always starts with a '/' (seems like it, but I didn't prove it), then it must be exactly 4 characters long: otherwise the loop will hit a slash and no underflow. 

If the merge_slashes directive is on (default), then there seems to be no way to make a 4-char URI without additional slashes.
If the merge_slashes is off, then: //../
